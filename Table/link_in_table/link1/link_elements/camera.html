        <p>A camera is a device used to capture and record images. It consists of a lens that focuses light onto a light-sensitive surface,<br>
             such as film or a digital sensor, to create a photograph or video. Cameras come in various types, including digital cameras,<br>
              which store images electronically, and film cameras, which use photographic film to record images. Cameras are widely used in photography, filmmaking,<br>
               surveillance, and many other applications.</p>
