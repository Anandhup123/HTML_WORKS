        Production: Curd is made by fermenting milk with lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. The bacteria ferment the lactose in the milk into lactic acid, which gives yogurt its tangy flavor and thick texture.
Nutritional Value: Curd is a good source of protein, calcium, potassium, and vitamins like B12 and riboflavin. It also contains probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that can improve gut health.
