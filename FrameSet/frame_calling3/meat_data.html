        Types: Meat generally refers to the flesh of animals that is used as food. Common types of meat include beef (from cattle), pork (from pigs), lamb (from sheep), and poultry (from chickens, turkeys, ducks, etc.). There are also more exotic meats like venison (from deer), rabbit, and game meats.
Nutritional Value: Meat is a rich source of protein, essential amino acids, vitamins (such as B vitamins, including B12), and minerals (such as iron and zinc). However, it can also be high in saturated fats.
