    <h2>Angular</h2>
    <img src="../imgs/ang.png" alt="" width="200px">
    <p> Angular is a popular open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community of developers. It is used for building dynamic web applications and offers features such as two-way data binding, dependency injection, and reusable components. Angular follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, for building applications. With Angular, developers can create single-page applications (SPAs) that provide a seamless user experience similar to desktop applications. The framework provides tools for routing, forms handling, and HTTP client communication, making it a comprehensive solution for building modern web applications.</p>
