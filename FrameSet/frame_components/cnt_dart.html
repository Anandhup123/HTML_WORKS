         is a popular server-side scripting language that is widely used for web development. It is especially well-suited for creating dynamic web pages and web applications. PHP code is embedded within HTML, allowing developers to mix logic with presentation seamlessly. PHP can interact with databases, manage session data, and handle file uploads, making it a versatile tool for building interactive websites. Additionally, PHP has a large and active community, which contributes to its extensive library of pre-built functions and frameworks, such as Laravel and Symfony, that simplify and accelerate the development process.</p>
