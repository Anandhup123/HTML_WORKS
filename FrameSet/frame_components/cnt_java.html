    <p> Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is known for its platform independence, which means that Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is used for developing a wide range of applications, from web and mobile apps to enterprise systems and embedded devices. It is known for its security, robustness, and performance, making it a popular choice for developers. Java's syntax is similar to C++, making it easy for developers to transition between the two languages. Additionally, Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that help developers build applications more efficiently.</p>
