    <p>Clay bricks are produced by the drying and firing of clay or shale raw material, forming a sintered porous structure.
        Similarly,the drying and sintering of pelletised clay or shale can produce a usable aggregate,
         but more especially if the raw material is capable of being 'bloated'.</p>
